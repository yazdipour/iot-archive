First run :
    i2cdetect -y 1
    sudo apt install libnfc5 libnfc-bin libnfc-examples

Once done , run :
    nfc-list -v 
    nfc-scan-device -v 

And if it doesn't show the reader , open this :
    sudo nano /etc/nfc/libnfc.conf
    
and add these 2 lines to the end of the file :
    device.name = "PN532 over I2C"
    device.connstring = "pn532_i2c:/dev/i2c-1"
    
Then running this , will show the device :
    nfc-scan-device -v

And then run this and it will read the card's data :
    nfc-poll
